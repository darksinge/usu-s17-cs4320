astounding special effects and an amazing cast besides chris pine who adds a
new dimension to kirk zachary quinto is spoton as the younger spock leonard

john cho as sulu anton yelchin as chekov and zoe saldana as uhura with a nod
to the television series origins bruce greenwood portrays a stoic captain
